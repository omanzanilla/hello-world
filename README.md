# hello-world
Getting started with the GitHub thingy :)
I've been working for years in matlab, developing new Machine Learning algorithms. 
Mostly, I've worked on the Binary Classification problem, but I've also done some work for Multi-category Classification and Pattern Visualization when in presence of multi-dimensional data.
I'm learning Python, and just got in touch with Python Ireland's guys. I'm working towards migrating all my developments so they are implemented in Python.
#My languages
R

Matlab / Octave (most of my experience is here!)

Python (just a newbie!)

SPSS scripting

VBA for Excel (yeah, I know it sucks!... but it is useful sometimes)
